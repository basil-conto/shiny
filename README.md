# shiny - Simple Shiny app with R

This app serves as a testing ground for the authors' exploration of R and the
Shiny framework. Its purpose is simply to visualise some statistical concept(s).

### Requirements

At minimum, you should have installed:

* an R distribution
* the Shiny R package

Having Rscript (which should come as part of a default distribution of R)
installed further allows you to run the app via the convenience script `run.R`.

### Usage

On GNU/Linux, running the convenience script `run.R` should fire up the app in
your default web browser. To run it just type `./run.R`.

WARNING: The following description for non-Linux operating systems has not been
tested.

On any other OS, given that Rscript is installed, you should be able to run
something along the lines of `Rscript run.R`, or perhaps `Rscript.exe run.R` on
Windows.
